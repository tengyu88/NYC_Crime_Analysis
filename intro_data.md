# NYC Crime Data Analysis

## Introduction Problem

This project is trying to answer the following questions by analyzing the crime data of NYC:

1. What are the most common crime types? Which borough had the most crime number?
2. Did some of the efforts of the police system and the social education system work? What is the trend of crimes declined?
3. What is the crime trend during a year? which month is the peak of crime?
4. Which area has the most concentrated crime that needs special attention? Is this area related to it's economic prosperity?
5. Can the crime trend of 2020 be predicted? 

## About the DATA

The data was collected and will be used as follows:

| Data name | Collected from | Used for|
|:-----:|:----:|:----:|
|NYPD_Complaint_Data_Historic.csv | NY Open Data | Analize the crime features and trends|
|NYC venues information | Foursquare | Analize the relationship between crime and economic prosperity|

There are a lot of information in the Complaint Data, here we mainly focus on some of them to answer the questions, ie. date, description, borough name and location(latitude and longitute). 
In order to simply evaluate and visualize the economic prosperity, the Foursquare API is used to acquire venue information. The economic prosperity is evaluated based on the desicity of venues on the map when serching the whole city.
